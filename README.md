   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/news-on-blockchain/chatbot.git
   cd chatbot
   ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)**  
   Create a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store environment-specific variables. Common variables may include:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Custom Settings**  
   Modify the `config.py` or similar configuration file to customize settings (e.g., bot responses, integration endpoints, etc.).

---

## Usage

1. **Running the Chatbot**  
   Run the chatbot using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Interacting with the Chatbot**  
   Once the chatbot is running, interact with it via the terminal or integrated UI (if applicable).

3. **Extending Functionality**  
   Add new intents or responses by updating the logic in the chatbot's codebase.
